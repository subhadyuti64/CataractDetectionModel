# Cataract Detection Model

Deployed Link : https://cataractdetectionmodel-rckgeetx7bjsnuqclr5led.streamlit.app/

This project aims to classify cataract eye images into two categories: **Mature Cataract** and **Immature Cataract** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It supports multiple deep learning backbones such as **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **DenseNet121**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle - Cataract Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshayramakrishnan28/cataract-classification-dataset).

It contains two classes:
- `Mature_Cataract`
- `Immature_Cataract`

---

## 🚀 Features

- Supports multiple model architectures.
- Generates classification report and confusion matrix.
- Easily extensible to other ophthalmic classification tasks.

---

## 🧠 Model Architectures

You can experiment with the following pretrained models (with transfer learning):

- VGG16
- ResNet18
- DenseNet121

Each model is fine-tuned for binary classification (mature vs immature cataract).
